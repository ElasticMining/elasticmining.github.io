#Analytics Plan: Question-driven or Data-driven?

**Data-Driven** is a HOT term recently. Your competitors feature themselves as data-driven organizations; they claim that they make data-driven decisions because all their departments are data-driven... data-driven marketing, data-driven sales, data-driven engineering and so on. It’s terrifying, but it’s the fashion! Now you think of being a data-driven organization too because everyone else is labeled with that. So you quickly extract all kinds of data you can find, from internal and external sources, and think to find something meaningful by analyzing them right away. 

Hey, wait a minute, are you sure you know what you are doing? Analyzing data it’s like swimming in a pool,  are you sure you know how to swim, which direction to go, and where the destination is?

We want to suggest you to start with a more important and powerful concept - **Question-Driven**. Instead of mining and analyzing your data without a clue, formulate questions that are of relevance to your business objective first. Then collect data for the purpose of answering your questions. In short, more specifically, we believe all analytics plans should be Question-Driven rather than Data-Driven.

ElasticMining has data experience in several domains and industries, we help you bridge the gaps to ensure flawless of your entire data process. We suggest the follow 4 steps of your project:


## (1) Plan

Determine ONE clear and quantifiable objective, then asking questions. Either you tell us your objective, or we help you define it. Furthermore, your key questions must clearly tie to business objective. 

***Business Objective → Key Questions***

For example, you objective is to minimize the marketing budget. Accordingly, you might formulate few related questions such as, 1) How has our marketing spending trended over time? 2) What marketing programs have been effective? Or, say your objective is to build a recommender that helps your users find related info easily. Related questions could be 1) What is the scale of users and items you want to recommend? 2) How much is your daily active logged-in user? ( **Suggest Read**: [RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS: FROM SMALL TO SCALE](http://www.elasticmining.com/post/2016-02-08/recommender-systems-from-small-to-scale.html) )


## (2) Collect

This is down to the part of data-driven, measure what matters. That is, to collect and acquire right data to answer your questions and unlock insight. Use sources/tools to acquire data you need and assemble them into a data management program for analysis. 

*Business Objective → Key Questions →**Data Needed→ Get From Sources***

Data you have or you collect will be in one of two forms, either unstructured or structured. The major difference between them is that the former doesn’t have a pre-defined data model, while the latter typically is well-defined and organized. One thing to be noted is that unstructured data are account for more than 70%–80% of all data in organizations.[1] Thus knowing how to deal with unstructured data is essential not just for today but also the future, as the amount of digital data is growing at a light speed. This is the big data era, and it only gets bigger and bigger.


## (3) Analyze

This is the step of getting insights that helps achieve your business objective. Since tidy data is the key to ensure error-free analysis, we need structured data that are with consistency and accuracy. Keep in mind that the analysis is for the propose of offering recommendations that help achieve the objective.

*Business Objective → Key Questions →  Data Needed→ Get From Sources → **Analyze → Get Insights***

There are roughly 5 primary analysis techniques used to analyze data:[2]

* Descriptive: Describes the main features of a collection of data.
* Inferential: Uses a small set of data to say something about larger set. 
* Exploratory: Seeks to discover connections and patterns in the data.
* Causal: Define the cause and fact of the data you have, for example, what happens to one variable when a change is made to another.
* Predictive: Predicts the future value, depends heavily on having the right data and data quality.


Don’t forget to include insights and words to summarize performance and recommend actions in every analysis. Use benchmarks, goals, or even prior performance to give some kind of context. 


## (4)Story

Compress all the things you learn from analyze step, and data visualization is a good way to show you a clear and memorable story. ( **Suggest Read:** [THE FIRST CLASS OF TABLEAU](http://www.elasticmining.com/post/2016-01-18/the-fisrt-class-of-tableau-part-1.html) )

*Business Objective → Key Questions → Data Needed→ Get From Sources → Analyze → Get Insights → **Storytelling by Data Visualizetion***

We’d like to briefly introduce and suggest the ways to visualize your data[3]:

* Bar Chart: Best used to show change over time, compare different categories, or compare parts of a whole.

* Pie Chart: Best used for making part-to-whole comparisons with discrete or continuous data. 
* ![Pie Chart](/img/blog/May/PieChart.png)



* Line Chart: Best used to show time-series relationships with continuous data, such as trend, acceleration, deceleration, and volatility.

* Area Chart: In addition to showing time-series relationship, they can represent volume, too.

* Scatter Plot: It shows the relationship between items based on two sets of variables.

* Bubble Chart: Best for displaying nominal comparisons or ranking relationships.

* Heat Map: Best for displaying categorical data, using intensity of color to represent values of geographic areas or data tables.
